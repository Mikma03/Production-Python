    "A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains a data field and a reference (or a link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be singly-linked (with each node pointing to the next node) or doubly-linked (with each node pointing to both the previous and the next node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists have several advantages over other linear data structures like arrays or Python lists. They allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, and their size can be easily changed during runtime. However, they do not provide constant-time access to individual elements and generally have a higher overhead due to the need for storing references to adjacent nodes.\n",

    "In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of each node that contains the address of the next node is usually called the 'next link' or 'next pointer'. The remaining fields are known as the 'data', 'information', 'value', 'cargo', or 'payload' fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'head' of a list is its first node. The 'tail' of a list may refer either to the rest of the list after the head, or to the last node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous')."
