# Introduction 

Arrays are the most commonly used data structure for many reasons. They are straightforward to understand and match closely the underlying computer hardware. Almost all CPUs make it very fast to access data at known offsets from a base address. Almost every programming language supports them as part of the core data structures. We study them first for their simplicity and because many of the more complex data structures are built using them.
