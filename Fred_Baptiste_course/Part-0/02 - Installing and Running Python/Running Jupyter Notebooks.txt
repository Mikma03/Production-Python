Running Jupyter Notebooks
=========================

From a command prompt:
1. Navigate to your project root folder.
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. run Jupyter notebooks: jupyter notebook .
4. If a web browser does not automatically open up, find the URL in the command prompt window (output when Jupyter starts up), and paste that URL into your browser.

You can create Jupyter notebooks anywhere in your project folder - it does not have to be in the root of your project folder, you can create sub-folders and organize your notebooks however you want - just like you wold organize Excel or Word documents.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------
- execute a cell: Shift+Enter
- select current cell: Esc (or click on cell margin)
- delete selected cell: DD (type D twice in succession)
- change selected cell to Markup: M
- change selected cell to Code: Y
- save: S
- insert cell above current selected cell: B
- insert cell after currently selected cell: A

Don't forget to re-run your Jupyter notebook when you re-load it later - this will just re-execute all the cells (but it will stop processing the cells if it encounters an error).
