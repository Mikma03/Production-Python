# Python Fundamentals

This folder contains all the downloadable materials for my Udemy **Python Fundamentals** course, available here:

[https://www.udemy.com/course/python3-fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/python3-fundamentals/?referralCode=DA09C6F40CEC38C942F6)

This folder is organized into the various sections of the course, and those themselves are organized by lesson within each chapter.


Resources include:

- Fully annotated Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the coding lessons.
- Any files we used during the coding lessons.
- Exercises for each chapter containing at least two files:
	- A Jupyter notebook with the questions.
	- A second Jupyter notebook with a fully annotated solution (you may have a different way of solving the problem and that's absolutely fine, as long as your code works, and is clear and easy to read).
	- if applicable, additional data files or materials needed to complete the exercises.


In the first chapter of this course I explain how to install and run Jupyter notebooks - please refer to that chapter if you need detailed instructions.
