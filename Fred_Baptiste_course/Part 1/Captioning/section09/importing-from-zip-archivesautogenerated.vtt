High in this video I want to talk about Zip packages.

00:04.370 --> 00:09.150
I've mentioned that a little while back in some of the videos and so I want to come back to it and just

00:09.150 --> 00:11.040
show you how that works.

00:11.040 --> 00:18.690
So here I've just taken the same project that we had when we were looking at how to structure packages

00:18.990 --> 00:21.080
and then how to import them.

00:21.090 --> 00:26.370
So remember we had that big common package with everything in it with the validators and the models

00:26.700 --> 00:27.800
and so on.

00:27.810 --> 00:35.820
So I'm going to just take that very same project and all I did is I took that folder common and I zipped

00:35.820 --> 00:38.700
it up and I called it common dot zip.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.200
I don't even have to call it common.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.640
I don't even have to call it Dot zip but I do have to just zip that up.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.680
So I left the extension to show that it's an archive.

00:48.270 --> 00:53.190
So now we want to import from common but common of course is in zip.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.940
So this isn't going to work.

00:54.960 --> 00:55.930
Let's try it.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.690
And it's not going to find it.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.170
It's going to say no there's no module named common.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.540
Well what about common Dadds zip.

01:02.550 --> 01:03.910
Maybe this would work.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.310
Let's try that.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.020
Will that work.

01:07.020 --> 01:10.110
And it says no it's for can find common.

01:10.140 --> 01:10.490
Right.

01:10.530 --> 01:11.600
It still can't find it.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.040
So this is not the solution.

01:14.700 --> 01:20.820
Let's go ahead and bring up a python console and here basically I would be trying to do this I would

01:20.820 --> 01:26.070
say import comic and that's not going to work because there is no module named com.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.260
So let's import this model.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.580
And you remember the cist path this tells Python where to look for packages.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.670
Well the thing is it doesn't know that it should look for packages and files inside common commandant

01:39.710 --> 01:40.490
zip.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.560
So we just need to tell it hey you need to look in this zip archive as well.

01:45.780 --> 01:47.220
So let's go ahead and do it.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.810
So he's going to say stop path that happened.

01:50.070 --> 01:54.970
And since the zip archive is actually in my zip package this project doesn't have to be.

01:55.110 --> 02:00.570
But since it is I can use a relative path so I'm going to say using the current directory.

02:00.630 --> 02:03.790
Go and look at common dot zip.

02:04.260 --> 02:04.920
OK.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.960
So now if I do this cannot import common.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.890
And the answer is yes I can.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.260
Common has been loaded up.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.320
There we go.

02:13.350 --> 02:18.800
Can I import something inside that's nested inside like common validator.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.660
And the answer again is yes I can.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.550
Right.

02:23.550 --> 02:25.470
So this is kind of pretty magical.

02:25.530 --> 02:31.380
I think it's really cool but you can essentially zip up your packages and then pull them out of that

02:31.410 --> 02:32.510
whenever you want.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.410
So let's see how we would fix.

02:34.410 --> 02:38.730
Now our main program to do that we just have to basically do this.

02:38.730 --> 02:43.310
That's all we have to do at the beginning of our program before we try and do those imports.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.720
So we're going to say imports this and then systole the path that append

02:51.420 --> 02:59.760
and we'll use the relative file path and will want to come in dock in November and we'll add the common

02:59.880 --> 03:05.580
zip to the suspects and now we should be able to run our program just as before.

03:05.730 --> 03:08.130
As you can see we've got the exit code of zero.

03:08.130 --> 03:14.660
It did all these imported called validators it was able to find posts and posts and user.

03:14.760 --> 03:22.580
We printed out the name spaces and so on and all those from files that were zipped up archived and is

03:22.760 --> 03:23.670
archived.

03:24.180 --> 03:24.610
That's it.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.350
That's as simple as it gets.

03:26.350 --> 03:28.650
So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
