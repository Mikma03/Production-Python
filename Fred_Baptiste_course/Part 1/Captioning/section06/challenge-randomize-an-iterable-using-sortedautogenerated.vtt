High in this video of a little fun challenge for you.

00:05.290 --> 00:11.420
You remember in the last video we looked at salted and how we can use salted salt a little salt any

00:11.430 --> 00:12.290
iterable.

00:12.820 --> 00:20.800
Well what I'd like you to try and do is to randomize a list or in any iterable for that matter.

00:20.800 --> 00:28.260
Also using the sorted function but instead of actually solving the thing I would like it to be randomized.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.880
So I'll give you a hint.

00:29.980 --> 00:34.630
You're going to have to import the random library.

00:34.870 --> 00:36.760
So we'll import random.

00:36.940 --> 00:41.100
And then in the random There is another function called random.

00:41.110 --> 00:49.660
So we can do it on random random and basically it's going to return a random number between 0 and 1

00:50.020 --> 00:51.280
not including 1.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.720
So if we call random dart random a few times we'll get different values on this.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.910
We execute that we execute.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.710
You can see we're getting different values.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.530
So now using what we learned in the previous section and using this right a piece of code that will

01:08.740 --> 01:13.490
randomize or if you want to think of shuffling right there will shuffle a list.

01:13.510 --> 01:19.570
Let's say the list is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

01:19.690 --> 01:20.330
That's good enough.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.520
And then ok whatever it doesn't matter it can be any list.

01:23.620 --> 01:28.760
So you should be able to produce that using a single line of code.

01:28.780 --> 01:32.090
So why don't you pause the video and tried up for yourself.

01:32.090 --> 01:39.310
First.

01:39.470 --> 01:40.140
All right.

01:40.140 --> 01:41.880
Hopefully you manage to do it.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.100
It's pretty straightforward right.

01:44.100 --> 01:47.030
Because remember how the sorted function works.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.930
It's going to sort whatever iterable is if you want and you can specify the key.

01:51.930 --> 01:54.350
Now what can we make with key in this case.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.720
Well we can make the key a random number and if we make the key a random number right.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.410
That means that we're going to essentially all do that list randomly.

02:04.410 --> 02:05.500
So what are we going to do.

02:05.510 --> 02:11.820
Well we're going to specify Alamdar and the land is going to take the element in the list but we're

02:11.820 --> 02:13.780
not going to worry about where the element is.

02:13.790 --> 02:19.200
So now we still have to provide that as a parameter because we still have to take that in.

02:19.230 --> 02:19.470
Right.

02:19.470 --> 02:23.370
The key is going to apply the function and pass it the element.

02:23.520 --> 02:30.720
But instead of using the element itself we're just going to call random random and so that will then

02:30.720 --> 02:38.100
get evaluated every time this function is applied and we're going to end up with a randomized list.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.180
So there you go.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.880
Now as you can see that's the thing we have here.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.100
We can run it again different right.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.160
Different sort.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.210
So that's kind of fun.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.840
On using the sort of method to actually create something that's randomized.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.330
Anyway thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
