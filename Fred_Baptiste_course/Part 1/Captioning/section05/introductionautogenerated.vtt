Hi and welcome to the section on function parameters.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.990
So in this section we're going to cover arguments and parameters for functions and we'll look at the

00:10.170 --> 00:13.520
formal difference between arguments and parameters.

00:13.530 --> 00:17.550
There's actually a slight difference between how we use these terms.

00:17.550 --> 00:23.210
Now I'll admit I'm the first one to kind of you know mix them up and use them interchangeably.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.390
And many people do.

00:24.420 --> 00:27.000
But technically there's a difference between the two.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.850
So we'll talk about that then we'll look at positional versus keyword only arguments that are available

00:32.850 --> 00:36.720
to us when we create functions in Python.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.540
Also we'll look at optional arguments by using default values and we'll look at some of the pitfalls

00:42.600 --> 00:46.390
of using default values with mutable types in particular.

00:46.620 --> 00:52.390
Then we'll look at unpacking iterable in general and then how it works and function arguments.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.940
Also look at extended unpacking.

00:55.170 --> 01:00.330
And then once we've done that we'll be able to start looking at variable number of positional and keyword

01:00.360 --> 01:01.820
only arguments.

01:01.830 --> 01:02.350
All right.

01:02.460 --> 01:05.460
So let's dive into the section and I'll see you in a bit.
