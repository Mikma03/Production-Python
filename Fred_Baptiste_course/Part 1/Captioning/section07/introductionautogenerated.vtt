00:00.550 --> 00:07.780
High and the section of the course we're going to look at two really important things closures and decorator's.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.350
But first we'll start with scope's.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.550
So we'll look at variable scopes and we'll look at things called the local scope.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.360
We'll look at the global scope.

00:16.390 --> 00:21.520
We'll also look at something called the non local scope and then we'll consider the fact that scopes

00:21.520 --> 00:22.540
can be nested.

00:22.660 --> 00:27.340
And so we'll discuss what scopes are and how they work in Python.

00:27.340 --> 00:33.580
Then we'll look at closures and what they are and as a hint they're not equivalent to lambda expressions

00:34.030 --> 00:37.690
very often closures and lambda expressions are studied together.

00:37.690 --> 00:41.260
And so you may think that well they're the same thing.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.560
They're not they're actually totally different.

00:43.570 --> 00:50.380
And this is why we actually studied lambdas fast and now only are we going to look at closures.

00:50.380 --> 00:55.240
Then we'll also look at closer scopes which is something that's really important and is an integral

00:55.240 --> 01:02.100
part of Clover's then we'll look at decorator's We'll look at what our decorator's We'll see how they

01:02.100 --> 01:08.850
related to closures and then we'll also look at the convenience as a sign that you can use the at symbol

01:08.880 --> 01:12.720
in Python for applying decorators and how all that's used.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.800
But you actually don't have to use that symbol.

01:15.810 --> 01:22.050
It's just a convenience feature that Python provides and we'll see how to do it without and then we'll

01:22.050 --> 01:25.840
look at quite a few applications of closures and decorators.

01:26.070 --> 01:26.590
All right.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.620
So this should be an interesting section.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.040
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
