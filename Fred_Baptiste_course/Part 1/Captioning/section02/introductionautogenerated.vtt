Hi and welcome to the section which is going to be a quick refresher on Python 3.

00:06.090 --> 00:11.820
First thing we'll look at will be the Python type hierarchy, and we'll limit our focus to the data types

00:11.820 --> 00:15.450
that we're going to work with in the schools.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.630
Next we'll look at multi-line statements and strings.

00:18.630 --> 00:24.030
Now we are interested in multi-line statements because we sometimes want to write our code over multiple

00:24.030 --> 00:29.610
lines for readability reasons. We don't want to have to scroll back and forth necessarily as we're looking

00:29.610 --> 00:32.670
at a line of code, well, just to break things up neatly.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.510
And then while we're at it we'll also look at multiline strings.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.640
Then we'll look at naming conventions.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.540
How do we name our variables, how do we name our methods.

00:41.550 --> 00:48.780
How do we name classes, and we'll look at some of the rules and some of the suggestions for these naming

00:48.960 --> 00:50.130
conventions.

00:50.130 --> 00:54.390
And it really becomes important to understand these naming conventions when we start getting into object

00:54.390 --> 00:55.440
oriented programming.

00:55.650 --> 01:00.890
But we'll cover that in a later section in this course. Next we'll look at conditionals.

01:00.940 --> 01:05.850
So like if statements for example are conditionals. Then we'll look at functions.

01:05.850 --> 01:10.710
Now this is not going to be a deep dive into functions, which is going to look at the basics of how to

01:10.860 --> 01:15.130
call a function, how to define our own functions, and parameters.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.520
But very simple stuff.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.520
Just the basics.

01:18.630 --> 01:23.940
Then we'll take a look at loops, and in particular we'll cover the while loop and the for loop, and then

01:23.940 --> 01:30.210
we'll also look at the break and continue statements, and we'll also look at how they behave when you

01:30.210 --> 01:32.640
have them and try statements inside a loop.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.840
What happens with the break and the continue.

01:35.070 --> 01:40.260
And then we'll also look at the else cause that can be added to for loops and while loops.

01:40.290 --> 01:43.110
All right so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
