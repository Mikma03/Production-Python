00:00.420 --> 00:06.510
High in this video we're going to look at how we can coerce a float to an integer.

00:07.050 --> 00:11.160
So in other words we want to take a float number of floating point numbers.

00:11.430 --> 00:17.380
Potentially with digits after the decimal point but we wanted to only take an integer of it then add

00:17.390 --> 00:20.250
the integer approximation essentially.

00:20.250 --> 00:25.870
So that means that we're going to have in general data loss it's inevitable if we have ten point two.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.350
Well what is the you know integer that represents ten point two.

00:29.390 --> 00:33.780
Well it's it's not going to be ten point two it's going to be 10 it's going to be 11.

00:33.810 --> 00:37.770
You know maybe something else but that's certainly not going to be ten point two because that's not

00:37.770 --> 00:38.470
an integer.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.310
So we have data loss.

00:40.380 --> 00:46.200
So there's different ways that we can go ahead in terms of you know how do we want this data loss to

00:46.200 --> 00:47.040
happen.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.480
And what I mean by this is let's take a look at some numbers.

00:49.530 --> 00:51.040
Let's look at ten point four.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.520
If we want to cross that to an integer.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.560
Well what should it be.

00:54.570 --> 00:57.020
Should it be 10 should be 11.

00:57.150 --> 01:02.440
Well this cases where you know you can make the argument that yeah I want it to be 11.

01:02.580 --> 01:07.470
Maybe that's what you want because maybe it's you know the number of times that you have to run a loop

01:07.470 --> 01:09.530
in order to make sure something gets completed.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.550
And then when you do a calculation and say that's ten point four.

01:12.810 --> 01:15.460
Well that means that 10 isn't quite enough.

01:15.780 --> 01:16.850
Eleven will be enough.

01:16.950 --> 01:21.330
So in other words you might actually want to take ten point four and make it into 11.

01:21.330 --> 01:27.060
When you look at it from an integer perspective in other cases maybe you doing computations or something

01:27.450 --> 01:33.970
and you know you say well no I want to take all the lower number I want to take 10 flip at ten point

01:33.970 --> 01:34.670
five.

01:34.750 --> 01:39.260
You know there again which you know where do we go is that 10 or is that 11.

01:39.280 --> 01:45.220
You know if we rounds using rounding up the kind of typical rounding we're used to we'd say well we're

01:45.220 --> 01:50.430
going to take 11 although tend to be an equally acceptable value.

01:50.490 --> 01:51.790
What about ten point six.

01:51.790 --> 01:52.880
Well that one maybe.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.570
Yeah we'll make that 11 that's closer to 11.

01:55.600 --> 02:02.560
You know we'll take the closest integer 0 and then also you have ten point or one or ten point nine

02:02.560 --> 02:03.550
nine nine nine.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.200
Where do you want to go you want to go to 10.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.060
You want to go to 11.

02:06.070 --> 02:08.740
Maybe something else but it has to be an integer.

02:09.010 --> 02:14.230
So there's different methods we can use to do all this stuff and we'll take a look at that in the next

02:14.230 --> 02:15.210
few videos.

02:15.250 --> 02:21.800
So we have truncation we have floor we have ceiling and we have rounding.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.180
So in this video we'll take a look at the first three.

02:24.220 --> 02:30.610
We'll keep rounding for a separate video because that can get into a pretty kind of detailed subject

02:31.630 --> 02:34.230
but in all cases you have data loss.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.440
So just pick your poison and you can have some data lost when you convert to an integer.

02:39.630 --> 02:41.390
So let's look at truncation first.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.250
So truncations simply returns the integer portion of the number.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.640
So basically it ignores everything after the decimal point and you just get the number that's to the

02:50.640 --> 02:52.520
left of the decimal point.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.690
Think of it that way.

02:54.030 --> 02:58.670
So the math module provides us with a truncation function called trunk.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.210
So we can use it this way.

03:00.210 --> 03:04.040
We have to import math first obviously then we can call math out of trunk.

03:04.110 --> 03:05.070
Ten point four.

03:05.100 --> 03:09.770
And that will return ten ten point five will return ten ten point six will also return 10.

03:10.050 --> 03:10.260
Right.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.970
We're just ditching what's after the decimal point.

03:14.070 --> 03:18.420
And it works the same way with negative numbers right which is digits after the decimal point.

03:18.420 --> 03:24.060
And we just retain the integer portion of that float.

03:24.060 --> 03:30.210
Now I want to talk about the int constructor very quickly here because the int constructor in Python

03:30.420 --> 03:36.950
accepts a float so it uses truncation when casting the float to an end.

03:37.140 --> 03:43.140
Now the words if you say into ten point four it's the same as saying trunk of ten point four.

03:43.140 --> 03:43.430
Right.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.440
And the same thing with these other numbers that we saw before.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.490
So if you don't want to you know if you want to use truncation and you don't want to import the math

03:50.700 --> 03:57.310
library or you don't want to import just the trunk from the math library you can also just use the constructor.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.460
And it will essentially return the same thing.

04:02.460 --> 04:03.800
So next we have a floor.

04:04.050 --> 04:09.090
So the floor of a number is the largest integer that is less than or equal to the number.

04:09.090 --> 04:16.680
So in mathematical notation the floor of X is the max of all than integers that are less than or equal

04:16.680 --> 04:17.820
to x.

04:17.820 --> 04:22.110
So let's take a look at an example of that it makes more sense if we use a number line.

04:22.500 --> 04:29.880
So here we have the number line 10 11 and then we have you know 12 13 14 and then 9 8 7 6 etc. on both

04:29.880 --> 04:34.770
sides and ten point four sits between 10 and 11.

04:35.310 --> 04:40.600
So the floor is the largest integer that is less than or equal to the number.

04:40.620 --> 04:45.600
So we're looking for the largest integer that is less than X or equal to x.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.660
But in this case less than X it's 10.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.820
So 10 is the floor.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.090
Now we also have to consider negative numbers.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.590
What's the law of negative ten point four.

04:56.480 --> 05:01.370
While you might be tempted to say it's negative 10 but it's not Y.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.370
Let's look at it on the number line again.

05:03.620 --> 05:10.420
So here's minus 11 minus 10 and he has minus ten point four right sitting right between those two.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.080
Again what's the floor.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.480
It is the largest integer less than or equal to x.

05:16.690 --> 05:22.040
But in this case the largest integer That's less than x is negative 11.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.870
And so that is the flaw.

05:24.170 --> 05:32.440
So the floor of ten point four is ten but the floor of negative ten point four is negative 11 so all

05:32.480 --> 05:37.140
positive numbers floor and truncation are actually equivalent right.

05:37.160 --> 05:43.090
If we took the trunk of X we would get 10 and the floor X would also be 10.

05:43.100 --> 05:49.730
And for any positive value that will be true but that is not the case for negative values.

05:49.820 --> 05:50.090
Right.

05:50.090 --> 05:53.260
The truncation of x in this case will be negative 10.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.090
But the floor is negative 11.

05:55.160 --> 06:00.140
So be careful Floren trunk are not the same thing when it comes to negative numbers.

06:01.890 --> 06:09.100
Not also want to talk very quickly again about flawed division we saw this div operated in a while back

06:09.580 --> 06:11.470
and remember how we defined it.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.500
We defined the flow division in combination with the MOD operators.

06:16.030 --> 06:18.750
And we said it satisfied this equality here.

06:18.820 --> 06:28.340
So this was integer division and this was the mod operator non-facts floor division and why.

06:28.360 --> 06:35.230
The reason why it's called floor division it's because it's defined this way a div B is precisely equal

06:35.230 --> 06:38.980
to the floor of a divided by being.

06:39.070 --> 06:43.040
So that's why we call that the float we call that a flawed division.

06:43.240 --> 06:49.890
And if we use this definition for floor division then it will drive the definition of the mud operator

06:50.110 --> 06:54.550
and it will always satisfy that equality OK.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.080
So let's look at the floor again.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.590
So the math module provides the floor function so we can get it from the math library.

07:03.870 --> 07:07.670
And if we get say math top floor of ten point four we get 10.

07:07.710 --> 07:08.890
We look at ten point five.

07:08.910 --> 07:17.010
Obviously any number within this interval here but not including 11 will floor to 10 if we have a number

07:17.010 --> 07:18.020
equal to 11.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.990
Its floor will be 11 right.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.410
Because the greatest the largest number less than or equal to x.

07:24.420 --> 07:24.630
Right.

07:24.630 --> 07:30.950
So in this case anything from 10 up to but not including 11 full floor to 10.

07:30.990 --> 07:36.000
And similarly with negative numbers we take any number in this interval here but excluding negative

07:36.000 --> 07:39.860
10 they will floor to negative 11.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.830
So all these will flow to negative 11.

07:43.910 --> 07:45.740
So the next one is ceiling.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.150
Seeing is kind of the opposite of floor floor.

07:49.190 --> 07:53.420
We took the largest integer less than or equal to the number for the ceiling.

07:53.420 --> 07:57.250
We're going to take the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.

07:57.320 --> 08:03.890
So again in mathematical notation the ceiling of X is the minimum over every integer such that that

08:03.920 --> 08:06.750
integer is greater than or equal to x.

08:06.860 --> 08:10.370
Again let's look at a number line.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.280
So here's our number line 10 11.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.650
And obviously it continues on.

08:13.680 --> 08:19.040
You know both ends of the spectrum and X sits somewhere inside that interval.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.010
So what's the ceiling.

08:20.070 --> 08:25.220
Well the ceiling is the smallest integers that's greater than or equal to the number.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.800
Well that would be 11 in this case right.

08:27.810 --> 08:34.170
11 is greater than x 10 is not greater than x 12 is also greater than x but it's not the smallest integer

08:34.320 --> 08:36.880
greater than x the smallest one is 11.

08:36.930 --> 08:39.450
So that's our ceiling.

08:39.590 --> 08:46.070
And obviously any number that falls within this interval excluding 10 will are ceiling to 11.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.800
Now let's look at negative numbers some negative numbers again which look at that number line.

08:53.860 --> 09:00.070
Negative 11 negative 10 X sits right in between the ceiling therefore is going to be negative 10.

09:00.370 --> 09:06.930
So the ceiling is negative 10 for any number in that interval here excluding negative 11.

09:06.940 --> 09:13.420
Obviously if the number is negative 11 or the number is 10 then the ceiling in this case would be 10

09:13.490 --> 09:13.740
right.

09:13.750 --> 09:18.980
Because we're looking at every number greater than or equal to the number we're looking at.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.380
So if we're looking at 10 then I you know equal to 10 is equal to 10 and therefore the minimum will

09:26.380 --> 09:27.070
be 10.

09:27.140 --> 09:31.920
But anyway just be careful with your open close intervals on the floor and the ceiling.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.580
So we'll look at some code.

09:35.580 --> 09:36.970
Next the next video.

09:36.970 --> 09:39.010
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in a bit.
