00:00.480 --> 00:05.400
High in this video we're going to continue our discussion on integers and in this case we're going to

00:05.400 --> 00:08.650
look at the different operations that we can do with integers.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.540
So vintages support all the standard arithmetic operations that we used to like addition subtraction

00:15.540 --> 00:21.800
multiplication division and even exponents using this double standard notation.

00:22.650 --> 00:28.420
But what is the resulting type of each operation is something that we should ask ourselves.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.160
In other words if we add two integers What do we get back.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.270
Well we get an integer back that kind of makes sense three plus four is seven.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.330
They're both integers 7 as integer.

00:38.340 --> 00:41.670
That's fine and subtraction will work the same way.

00:41.730 --> 00:47.080
Multiplication will work the same way if you multiply two ints you get an int back and if you might

00:47.130 --> 00:52.500
you know if you take the exponent of one into another again you'll get an integer back 2 to the power

00:52.500 --> 00:55.330
of two is for which you know they're all integers.

00:55.350 --> 00:59.620
So that kind of makes sense but division is a little bit different.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.300
Division will always return a float.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.740
Now it's pretty obvious when we do something like three divided by four right.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.130
That 0.75.

01:08.130 --> 01:14.220
So we can't expect 0.75 to be an integer data type and it's going to have to be a float which is what

01:14.220 --> 01:19.580
Python will return but maybe not so obvious is that if you do 10 divided by two.

01:19.860 --> 01:21.840
Well yes the answer is five.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.230
Technically it's an integral number but it will still get returned as a float type.

01:27.240 --> 01:32.870
I will see that in the code section so Division will always return a float.

01:33.870 --> 01:40.150
So that gets us to two more operators that we have when we're dealing with integers.

01:40.540 --> 01:44.160
So first let's take a look back to long division.

01:44.250 --> 01:50.320
And remember that from our grade school and that's when you wanted to divide you know you had a fraction

01:50.320 --> 01:54.680
like 155 over four and you did long division on that.

01:54.690 --> 02:01.360
We at that time you didn't have a concept of a decimal point and numbers after the decimal point everything

02:01.360 --> 02:02.660
was working of integers.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.580
So let's take a look at that.

02:05.020 --> 02:05.320
Right.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.320
So first just some terminology the top number here is called the numerator.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.530
The bottom here is called the denominator.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.360
So we're going to take a 155 divided by four.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.660
We're going to take that long division approach.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.700
So 4 goes into 15 three times so that's 12.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.890
So that leaves us with three.

02:26.890 --> 02:29.230
Bring down the five we have 35.

02:29.290 --> 02:35.910
Once more four goes into thirty five at most eight times which is a value of 32.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.300
We're left with three and four doesn't go into three.

02:39.400 --> 02:39.960
That's it.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.680
We're done with a long division.

02:41.830 --> 02:50.690
And so we would write down our answer and say well 155 divided by four is 38 with remainder three.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.890
So we can also put it another way.

02:53.110 --> 03:00.850
And this is going to be the more important way of rephrasing this statement here which is that 155 is

03:01.120 --> 03:04.540
four times thirty eight plus three.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.040
So 155.

03:06.460 --> 03:06.830
Right.

03:06.850 --> 03:12.600
Is four times the number 38 Plus the remainder.

03:12.630 --> 03:15.360
So we're going to give this name.

03:15.360 --> 03:21.010
Essentially we're going to say we're going to define some operator that we denote by a double slash

03:21.010 --> 03:25.380
or double division 155 slash slash.

03:25.380 --> 03:31.540
For that we'll return that number 38 and we're going to define another operator.

03:31.650 --> 03:33.120
This percent sign here.

03:33.170 --> 03:37.920
So one 55 percent for will return that remained a turn.

03:38.180 --> 03:47.510
So if we use that notation then we get that 155 is four times this expression here plus this expression.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.210
This expression will evaluate to 38.

03:50.330 --> 03:54.970
And this one will evaluate to three.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.930
So four times thirty eight plus three.

03:57.990 --> 04:00.300
We get 155 back.

04:00.590 --> 04:07.730
So this operator here is called the floor division which I'm just going to say Divx for short but it's

04:07.730 --> 04:09.870
a you know it's an integer division.

04:09.950 --> 04:14.460
But more specifically it's a flow of division right.

04:14.480 --> 04:20.410
That's the name of that operation and this operation hit this operator here is called the Martillo operator

04:20.600 --> 04:23.300
which I'll just show usually as maade.

04:23.360 --> 04:28.920
So we'll have div and maade as these two operators slash slash and that percent sign.

04:30.370 --> 04:34.430
And the thing is about these two operators that they always satisfy.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.050
Exactly that equation that we saw here.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.200
So in general they always satisfy this equation.

04:41.410 --> 04:46.550
Where n means the numerator and D means the denominator.

04:46.570 --> 04:51.580
So we have the numerator like 155 is equal to d the denominator.

04:51.580 --> 05:01.720
Like for in this case times n Dev D 155 the full plus and mod d 155 mod 4.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.400
So this is an important equation because that will come back again and again as we discussed the div

05:07.440 --> 05:11.110
in the mud operators so forth.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.730
What is flawed division.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.360
Exactly what do we mean by floor division right.

05:15.370 --> 05:17.370
We gave it a name we gave it a symbol.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.700
But what is it exactly.

05:18.850 --> 05:24.720
Well first we have to define what the floor of a number is and we can take the floor of any real number.

05:24.940 --> 05:25.370
Right.

05:25.510 --> 05:28.360
It's not necessarily of an integer.

05:29.050 --> 05:37.140
So the floor of a real number is the largest integer less than or equal to a.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.330
And that's really important to understand that.

05:40.630 --> 05:42.130
And you'll see why in a bit.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.370
But it is the largest in the standard number order rights.

05:45.400 --> 05:52.660
If you draw out on a number line then you look at the number on the number line and you find the largest

05:52.680 --> 05:59.350
which means to the left of it the largest number less than the largest integer number less than or equal

05:59.350 --> 06:01.030
to the number you're looking at.

06:01.050 --> 06:01.520
OK.

06:03.130 --> 06:10.830
So for example the floor of 3.1 for well the largest integer less than 3.1 for is 3.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.110
Same thing with one point nine nine nine nine.

06:13.150 --> 06:21.470
The largest integer less than 1 point nine nine nine nine is one k the floor of two.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.860
Well it's two right.

06:22.870 --> 06:31.190
Because the largest integer less than or equal to two is to itself but watch out for negative numbers.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.860
This is where the definition is important.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.980
What's the floor of minus three point one.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.030
Well you might be tempted to say what was minus three right with truncating.

06:41.030 --> 06:45.170
Here we're just taking the integer portion of the number and throwing away the decimal points.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.660
But what comes after the decimal point.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.120
That's not quite how it works.

06:49.130 --> 06:54.980
Let's look at the number line right here's another line he negative 4 and is negative 3 and the number

06:54.980 --> 06:58.280
the within that we're interested in is minus 3.1.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.530
That's between those two values.

07:00.530 --> 07:06.450
Now if we look at the definition again a floor it is the largest integer less than or equal to eight.

07:06.680 --> 07:15.130
Well what's the largest integer less than minus 3.1 minus for it's not minus three minus three is greater

07:15.130 --> 07:22.190
than minus 3.1 so minus 4 is in fact the floor of minus 3.1.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.360
So that's an important distinction.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.600
Floor is not the same thing as truncation.

07:27.690 --> 07:32.440
It is the same when you're dealing with positive numbers but not have negative numbers.

07:32.560 --> 07:42.290
And that has an impact on the not operators that we saw so we get to our definition of flawed division

07:42.530 --> 07:46.560
a div B is the floor of a divided by B.

07:46.580 --> 07:53.180
Right so if you get some they divided by B that gives zero minus 3.1 as a result then you take the floor

07:53.180 --> 08:00.480
which will be negative 4 and you will get minus 4 as your floor.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.360
Now let's look back at that formula again.

08:03.400 --> 08:03.730
Right.

08:03.730 --> 08:08.710
Remember that 40 that we that we wrote down that we said are not using any of these anymore it doesn't

08:08.710 --> 08:09.860
really matter.

08:10.360 --> 08:15.460
Let's look at an example that's like eight to 135 and be equal to four.

08:15.940 --> 08:21.640
So 135 divided by four is thirty three point seven five or thirty three and three quarters.

08:21.670 --> 08:21.940
Right.

08:21.940 --> 08:28.600
So now if we did long division we would say only 35 divided by four is thirty three with a remainder

08:28.600 --> 08:34.470
of three so 135 four is thirty three.

08:34.530 --> 08:34.810
Right.

08:34.810 --> 08:42.090
Because so 3.7 5 floor is 33 135 not four.

08:42.390 --> 08:47.160
Turns out to be three that remainder that we have.

08:47.440 --> 08:54.280
And in fact if we look at this equation again and I'll bring up that equation many times then we have

08:54.370 --> 09:00.690
four times 135 four plus 135 mug full.

09:00.880 --> 09:01.180
Right.

09:01.180 --> 09:04.870
For being that denominator over here.

09:06.230 --> 09:12.320
So we get it four times thirty three plus three which is 132 plus three which is 135 which is indeed

09:12.470 --> 09:13.790
equal to a.

09:13.950 --> 09:16.850
So now let's deal with negative numbers.

09:16.850 --> 09:20.170
This is where things get a little crazy.

09:20.190 --> 09:27.030
So again I want to reiterate a div B is not the integer portion of a divided by B it is not the truncation

09:27.120 --> 09:28.310
of a divided by B.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.280
It is the floor of a divided by B.

09:32.280 --> 09:38.250
Now if a and b are both greater than zero then yeah it is the same thing but not when we are dealing

09:38.250 --> 09:39.590
with negative numbers.

09:40.590 --> 09:48.280
So let's look at an example let's say a is minus 135 negative 1 3 5 and B is 4.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.270
So same as before except we've made a negative.

09:51.270 --> 09:55.290
So now if we do the division Well that's minus thirty three point seventy five.

09:55.290 --> 10:06.030
So you know we might say it's minus 33 in three quarters so minus 135 divided by four in div..

10:06.190 --> 10:06.760
Right.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.660
One might wonder if I divided by four is minus thirty three point seventy five.

10:10.810 --> 10:16.210
But the div is the floor of that the floor of this number is negative 34.

10:16.210 --> 10:23.680
Compare that to when we had 135 of four which was 33 case already we see there's a difference in the

10:23.680 --> 10:25.400
div value.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.070
What about the mud.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.380
We say minus 135 not four.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.750
We get a 1 whereas before we got a three.

10:34.750 --> 10:38.880
Now remember that the model is not the remainders.

10:38.950 --> 10:41.400
Right in the sense that it's not 3.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.880
It's just something that has to satisfy that equation.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.560
But we've talked about it and I'll keep bringing up again and again the divin model operators are defined

10:53.560 --> 11:01.510
and calculated in such a way that this equation here always holds so let's check let's make sure it

11:01.540 --> 11:02.800
holds in this case.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.660
Well we have four right.

11:04.660 --> 11:12.090
The B was four times minus 135 div 4 plus minus 135 mudflow.

11:12.300 --> 11:18.300
So if we do that calculation here we have four times minus 34 plus one.

11:18.490 --> 11:26.050
And so we get minus 136 plus 1 which is minus 135 and that matches the minus 135.

11:26.080 --> 11:33.190
So as you can see thats how the divin mud operators work and they work in such a way that that equation

11:33.190 --> 11:35.860
is always satisfied.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.290
So let's expand this a little further.

11:38.680 --> 11:47.050
Let's take equal to 14 and be equal to 4 of 13 divided by 4 is 3.2 vine.

11:47.260 --> 11:51.840
Now let's take equal to negative 13 and be equal to still four.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.530
Now we've just made a negative.

11:53.980 --> 11:58.290
Well minus 13 divided by 4 is minus 3.5.

11:58.840 --> 12:04.050
Let's take a look at when we stick the negative sign not with a bid with B.

12:04.060 --> 12:10.870
So we leave at 13 and we may be equal to negative 4 then 13 divided by negative four is still minus

12:10.940 --> 12:11.940
3.5.

12:11.970 --> 12:12.210
Right.

12:12.210 --> 12:16.780
When would the regular division it doesn't matter if you put the negative sign you know in the numerator

12:16.890 --> 12:23.210
and denominator and lastly let's look at when both of them have a negative sign.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.760
Now we know that we do regular division.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.400
The negative signs cancel out.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.680
And in fact it's still a positive.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.900
3.2 Vire.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.290
Just like we had here.

12:33.340 --> 12:33.930
OK.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.160
Now let's look at the Duve right.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.190
Well the deal for 13 and 4 is 3 right 4 goes into 13.

12:40.190 --> 12:48.490
Three times this year also it's going to be 3.2 fives floor which is three here the div is going to

12:48.490 --> 12:52.610
be the floor of minus three point to five which is going to be minus 4.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.300
What about the div here.

12:54.370 --> 12:59.240
Well same thing it's going to be the floor of minus 3.5 which is negative 4.

12:59.680 --> 13:05.420
And here the the div is going to be the floor of 3.2 5 which gets us back to 3.

13:05.560 --> 13:10.960
So as you can see this looks you know this kind of follows the signs that we had with just regular division

13:10.960 --> 13:12.730
as well.

13:12.730 --> 13:16.050
Now let's look however the mud's are affected.

13:16.330 --> 13:22.510
Well 13 March 4 is 1 minus 13 month 4 is actually 3.

13:22.750 --> 13:29.600
And we'll see that when we check the equation 13 MMOG negative 4 is negative 3.

13:29.620 --> 13:36.420
So you'll notice how this mod is basically carrying the sign of the second portion here.

13:36.640 --> 13:42.760
Right of the denominator if you want to think of it as a fraction for 13 Mont. negative 4 is negative

13:42.760 --> 13:43.750
3.

13:43.880 --> 13:50.260
And here's another interesting one minus 13 month negative four is negative 1 it's carrying the sign

13:50.290 --> 13:52.400
of this second one here.

13:53.320 --> 13:57.270
And in each of these cases it satisfies that equation.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.750
Let's check.

14:00.110 --> 14:09.110
So in the first one we have four times 13 the full plus 13 model which is 12 plus 1 which is 13 so we're

14:09.110 --> 14:12.240
good matched for about the next one.

14:12.320 --> 14:18.990
Well four times minus 13 the full plus minus 13 month for is minus 13.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.150
It matches minus 13 we're good.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.710
And the same thing here that matches as well.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.780
And lastly this one here.

14:27.860 --> 14:28.210
Right.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.610
We have minus four times minus 13.

14:31.880 --> 14:39.500
Minus four plus minus 13 Mada month for a negative 4 gives us minus 12 minus 1 which is minus the teen.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.070
And again that matches.

14:42.120 --> 14:42.900
All right.

14:42.960 --> 14:48.900
So when you get when you start dealing with negative numbers it's a lot more complicated you have to

14:48.900 --> 14:50.580
be a little careful with that.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.410
OK.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.750
So now let's look at some code and check this out.

14:55.050 --> 15:00.930
So the first thing we're going to look at is the types when we do these arithmetic operations so we

15:00.930 --> 15:03.850
can look at the type of one plus one.

15:04.010 --> 15:05.200
And that gives us an hint.

15:05.280 --> 15:05.600
Right.

15:05.610 --> 15:12.250
We expect that that we do one times while it's two maybe two times three type of that is.

15:12.290 --> 15:18.890
And look at the type of let's say subtraction let's say full minus 10 that's a negative number but it's

15:19.070 --> 15:23.260
an integer and same thing with exponents of integer numbers.

15:23.280 --> 15:31.080
If we do three to the power of six while that type is still in and now division is different we do type

15:31.080 --> 15:33.700
of two divided by three.

15:33.780 --> 15:40.990
While we would expect that to be a float right because the two divided by three is you know 0.6 6:06

15:41.070 --> 15:43.630
recurring and it is indeed a float.

15:43.800 --> 15:49.440
Now what's more interesting is if we do 10 divided by two right then divided by two is five.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.300
But the type is the float.

15:51.300 --> 15:56.030
Now we can print 10 divided by two it will print 5 1 0 right.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.480
If we do the actual print you got to be careful with that.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.770
It's going to format it as 5.0.

16:02.970 --> 16:07.980
So if you wanted to print out as an end you're going to have to do some formatting.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.050
OK.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.130
Now next thing we should look at is the floor method.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.470
Now the floor method is in the math manual.

16:15.470 --> 16:18.420
It's not part of the standard syntax.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.160
So we're going to import math.

16:20.490 --> 16:21.900
And now we can use the floor.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.850
So let's take a look at the floor.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.090
Three point one five.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.090
OK.

16:27.210 --> 16:29.800
And as we expect it's three right.

16:29.830 --> 16:36.810
We do math that flow of three point nine nine nine nine nine nine.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.350
It's all three right.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.500
This is not a rounding.

16:39.510 --> 16:41.940
It's basically taking the integer portion.

16:42.030 --> 16:46.630
When we're dealing with positive integers or positive numbers.

16:47.130 --> 16:47.740
OK.

16:47.820 --> 16:55.210
Now not so if we're looking at negative numbers you can look at three minus three point one four.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.560
And what do we get minus four.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.680
That's the flow.

16:58.800 --> 17:03.540
Right now we can even look at the math top floor of minus three point.

17:03.540 --> 17:07.350
Let's say six zeros one two three four five six and one right.

17:07.350 --> 17:08.430
The floor of that.

17:08.460 --> 17:08.970
Yes.

17:08.970 --> 17:19.600
Very close to negative three and I go type of correctly it's still negative for k.

17:19.940 --> 17:24.340
So we are not rounding we're not truncating We are taking the floor.

17:24.350 --> 17:29.710
The largest integer less than or equal to this value here.

17:29.950 --> 17:33.950
Now I want to sidetrack very quickly into something else.

17:33.950 --> 17:37.970
So I want to show you that just so you're aware of it and we'll come back and discuss this later.

17:38.030 --> 17:40.460
Let's go ahead and add I'm going to add 12 zeros.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.410
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

17:44.570 --> 17:45.780
And then a 1.

17:45.860 --> 17:49.910
Now we would expect that the floor of that should still be negative 4.

17:50.060 --> 17:51.190
Right.

17:51.860 --> 17:52.820
That's fine.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.180
Now let's try this again

17:57.440 --> 18:00.600
and I'm going to put in three more zeros.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.680
And now the floor is negative 3.

18:03.740 --> 18:04.950
What's going on.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.430
Well it has to do with the fact that floats have a limit of precision in Python.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.080
So minus three point.

18:12.080 --> 18:18.830
And then here we had 15 zeros and one is actually being represented as minus three zeros and the one

18:18.830 --> 18:19.810
gets dropped.

18:19.970 --> 18:20.330
OK.

18:20.420 --> 18:25.340
So it has to do with the limited precision that we have with floating point numbers and we'll get to

18:25.340 --> 18:28.420
that in the video on floating points.

18:28.430 --> 18:30.250
So just be aware of that.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.190
OK.

18:32.670 --> 18:35.960
So now let's look at the floor division operators.

18:36.180 --> 18:40.380
So let's take a look at an example let's take equal to 33.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.810
Be equal to 16.

18:41.940 --> 18:47.500
And we're going to print a divided by the K.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.100
We're going to print a div B.

18:51.600 --> 18:59.870
And we're going to print the floor of a divided by B right which should be equal to a div B.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.300
That's the definition.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.150
So let's see what results we get.

19:03.150 --> 19:13.100
So 33 divided by 16 is two point zero six to five a div B as 2 which is the floor of 2.0 six to five

19:13.620 --> 19:18.490
the largest integer less than or equal to this number here.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.890
So in both cases that was.

19:21.950 --> 19:27.730
Now let's just do an example now using a negative number equals 16.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.080
So we'll keep everything else the same.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.750
But just a becomes negative.

19:31.030 --> 19:33.350
And we're going to print out the same things.

19:33.370 --> 19:38.600
I'm going to copy paste and here's where we get right.

19:38.680 --> 19:44.620
Divided by B is minus 2.0 six to five a div B is negative 3.

19:44.740 --> 19:45.070
Right.

19:45.070 --> 19:50.070
It is the largest integer less than this number here.

19:50.170 --> 19:57.800
While the largest integer less than the number is actually negative 3 and of course the floor matches

19:58.010 --> 20:00.840
because that's the definition of flawed division.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.370
Now I want to compare and contrast.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.850
Our truncation.

20:04.850 --> 20:05.410
Right.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.120
So let's look at this one again.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.840
So I'm just going to copy and paste this code in here.

20:10.250 --> 20:15.950
And we'll look at truncation and for truncation will print math.

20:16.030 --> 20:20.700
The DOT trunk a divided by B.

20:21.020 --> 20:26.040
And as you can see the truncation is just giving us the integer portion of this number here.

20:26.150 --> 20:32.300
It's basically dropping everything after the decimal point and returning to us just the integer portion

20:32.360 --> 20:35.750
of this floating point numbers which is negative 2.

20:36.050 --> 20:41.240
So as you can see here when we're dealing with negative numbers the floor and the trunk are not the

20:41.240 --> 20:42.170
same thing.

20:42.260 --> 20:48.680
And so in general Floren truncation is not the same thing it is with positive numbers but in general

20:48.680 --> 20:50.200
you have to include negative numbers.

20:50.210 --> 20:53.080
It is not so just a little caveat.

20:53.660 --> 20:57.230
OK so let's look at the not operator an artist.

20:57.240 --> 21:08.280
Again I want to remind you of the equation equals B times a div B plus a moderate B.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.330
So let's look at some examples of this.

21:11.360 --> 21:15.520
Let's say eight equals 13 and B equals 4.

21:15.950 --> 21:18.560
And we're going to print out the division.

21:18.590 --> 21:23.960
So now we've got a few more things I'm going to actually try and format it a little bit.

21:24.170 --> 21:26.590
So 0 divided by 1.

21:26.780 --> 21:30.140
The positional arguments equals two.

21:30.380 --> 21:35.330
And we're going to throw in a b and divided by B.

21:35.550 --> 21:42.180
Ok then we're going to print out the div of those two things.

21:42.200 --> 21:54.650
So let's go ahead and say that the one equals to start format's a b a div B.

21:54.650 --> 21:58.090
Right so we're going to print out the results of the div.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.100
Lastly we're going to do the a mod B.

22:03.260 --> 22:03.890
So

22:08.250 --> 22:11.220
this way.

22:12.570 --> 22:13.530
Okay.

22:14.150 --> 22:20.550
And lastly one thing I want to do is check and make sure that this equation is indeed being satisfied.

22:20.810 --> 22:32.180
So I'm going to print out is a equal to watch should be equal to B times a div B plus a mod B.

22:32.210 --> 22:34.700
I don't have to put parentheses around this.

22:34.700 --> 22:38.480
This has higher precedence than the plus.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.420
But if you prefer There's no harm in putting extra parentheses.

22:42.530 --> 22:43.630
So we can put it in.

22:44.090 --> 22:49.170
OK so let's take a look at our results and of course I have to close off the print statements.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.590
So there we go.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.160
All right so 13 divided by four is 3.2 fire.

22:54.170 --> 22:58.100
That was a float 13 div 4 was 3.

22:58.100 --> 23:01.140
The floor of that 13 not 4 is 1.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.940
And that equation is satisfied you can see that it returns true.

23:04.940 --> 23:08.630
So A's indeed equal to this whole expression.

23:09.490 --> 23:11.690
I'd go ahead and do this as well.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.570
For negative numbers.

23:13.580 --> 23:17.830
So let's take a call to negative 13 and be equal to four.

23:17.960 --> 23:22.680
So we're going to run through the same examples that we had in the slides.

23:23.060 --> 23:28.640
And as you can see we get minus three point five for the division minus four for the floor Division

23:28.990 --> 23:32.420
3 for the MOD and that equation is satisfied.

23:32.420 --> 23:37.310
So I just want to basically go through and make sure that the equation is satisfied in every instance.

23:37.310 --> 23:43.650
So again will copy paste that that's and will stick the negative on the full.

23:43.660 --> 23:51.460
This time we'll leave the positive thought in the long run that and as you can see our equation evaluated

23:51.460 --> 23:52.520
to true.

23:52.840 --> 24:01.880
So again that works and let's do one more where we're going to set both a and b to negative.

24:02.230 --> 24:09.490
And when we run that well again we get that the equation evaluated to true right.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.400
So in other words that equation was valid.

24:11.410 --> 24:16.080
So that expression evaluated true which means that the equation.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.730
And this is the last time I'll mention it in this video.

24:18.820 --> 24:22.990
This equation here was indeed valid.

24:22.990 --> 24:23.290
All right.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.310
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
