00:00.510 --> 00:08.070
High in this video we're going to switch to some code and look at truncation ceiling and floor that

00:08.130 --> 00:09.920
we looked at in the previous video.

00:10.110 --> 00:15.110
So the first thing is we're going to need the trunk function from the math module.

00:15.120 --> 00:23.400
So from math we'll import trunk and you can always as usual do help if you want.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.410
On that it will tell you exactly what it does it takes some real numbers.

00:27.690 --> 00:31.500
In this case we're going to use floats but could use other real number types as well.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.450
And it will convert it to an integral type and an integer in particular.

00:36.450 --> 00:41.630
So let's try this let's say we're going to do trunk of ten point three.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.160
Look at the ten point five.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.230
Kind of halfway between 10 and 11 and then we'll even look at ten point nine.

00:49.230 --> 00:57.960
So it doesn't matter how close or how far we are from 10 as long as that prefix is 10 before the decimal

00:57.960 --> 01:01.760
point the truncation will just return the integer portion.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.020
So this isn't rounding.

01:03.150 --> 01:07.560
This is just basically ditching everything after the decimal point.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.450
Now the end constructive.

01:09.510 --> 01:12.620
So we do have help on.

01:13.020 --> 01:20.010
You'll notice that it can take a constructor where X is can be a number one in particular it can be

01:20.010 --> 01:20.730
a float.

01:20.820 --> 01:31.860
So we can also do the same thing we can say and ten point four and ten point five and in ten point nine.

01:31.860 --> 01:35.440
And you'll notice that it returns 10 10 and 10 in each case as.

01:35.460 --> 01:40.400
The constructor actually uses truncation when you pass it a real number.

01:40.810 --> 01:41.390
OK.

01:41.550 --> 01:43.230
So that's truncation.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.930
Next one we have is flawed.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.900
And again the math module has the floor function so we can say from math import floor.

01:52.320 --> 01:58.910
And again if you want to help on floor and it just tells you what it does.

01:59.060 --> 01:59.730
OK.

02:00.090 --> 02:05.660
So this is the largest integer less than equal to x as we saw in the previous video.

02:05.670 --> 02:14.910
So we can look at the floor of ten point three and the floor of ten point four groups of ten point five

02:15.300 --> 02:17.360
and the floor of ten point nine.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.100
And again we would get 10 10 and 10.

02:20.250 --> 02:23.880
So you might think oh well this is the same thing as truncation.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.950
Not really.

02:25.080 --> 02:25.380
Right.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.180
The difference is because of negative numbers.

02:28.200 --> 02:36.660
So if we look at the truncation of negative ten point four negative ten point five or negative ten point

02:36.660 --> 02:39.470
nine.

02:39.520 --> 02:47.200
How about I put trunked around each one like to help.

02:48.200 --> 02:48.860
And

02:51.350 --> 02:52.420
trunk.

02:52.770 --> 02:53.340
OK.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.680
So negative 10 negative 10 negative 10.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.260
As we said with truncation we'll just ditch everything after the decimal point and we're left with just

03:01.260 --> 03:03.410
the integral portion of the numbers.

03:03.570 --> 03:12.190
However if we take this and let's go ahead and I'll copy paste and then I'll change these the two floor.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.070
And again I'm just going to copy paste

03:17.280 --> 03:18.900
then here's what happens.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.220
The floor of negative ten point four is negative 11.

03:22.260 --> 03:25.180
The truncation is negative 10 but the floor is negative 11.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.300
We saw that in the previous video.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.360
All right so just be careful Floren truncation doesn't mean the same thing.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.060
And it does when the numbers are positive.

03:34.400 --> 03:41.180
But it stops meaning the same thing as being equal when the numbers are negative and then the last one

03:41.180 --> 03:42.700
we have is seeing.

03:42.710 --> 03:45.410
So from the math simple.

03:45.540 --> 03:46.350
Seal.

03:46.670 --> 03:47.070
OK.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.350
And again we can get help on that method.

03:53.420 --> 03:53.700
OK.

03:53.750 --> 03:58.250
So here's the function returns the ceiling of x as an integral This is the smallest integer greater

03:58.250 --> 03:59.180
than or equal to x.

03:59.180 --> 04:05.960
Again we saw that in the previous video so we can look at the ceiling of ten point four the ceiling

04:05.960 --> 04:10.160
of ten point five and the ceiling of ten point nine.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.330
And those will all be 11.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.940
Right it's going to look for the next basically integer.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.280
That's greater than that those numbers that we have here.

04:19.760 --> 04:25.280
Now of course when we deal with negative numbers again we always have to be a little careful with that

04:25.940 --> 04:32.360
because what is the negative number that's greater than negative ten point four or negative ten point

04:32.360 --> 04:36.930
five or negative ten point nine.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.470
You know that's the next step up.

04:39.710 --> 04:42.130
Well it is negative 10 right.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.060
Because think of the number line.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.960
Negative 10 is greater than negative ten point four.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.420
And that's what we're looking for.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.210
Right.

04:49.220 --> 04:56.390
So we're looking for the smallest integer that's greater than or equal to the number that we pass into

04:56.390 --> 04:57.590
the function.

04:57.590 --> 04:57.980
All right.

04:57.980 --> 05:03.290
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video where we start looking at the round function.
