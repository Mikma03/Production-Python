High in the section we're going to talk about topples.

00:05.070 --> 00:07.000
So what are topples.

00:07.110 --> 00:11.880
You're probably thinking well if you already know what topples are they just immutable lists they're

00:11.970 --> 00:14.150
Read-Only lists essentially.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.780
And that's definitely how many introductions to Python will present topples as immutable lists.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.880
Now there's nothing technically wrong with that.

00:22.950 --> 00:27.960
A topple is after all a sequence type just like a list is a sequence type.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.190
But the table is indeed immutable.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.480
So it's a read only list but that's kind of missing half of the story with topples.

00:36.510 --> 00:42.660
There's a lot more going on with topples that if we don't kind of understand that we're going to miss

00:42.660 --> 00:48.630
out on some really interesting stuff that we can do with them as an analogy let's think about strings

00:48.720 --> 00:53.840
not strings are also sequenced types just like a top bulldust like a list.

00:54.120 --> 01:00.870
But if you think of a string there's something else going on in a string than just you know a list of

01:00.870 --> 01:07.960
values a list of characters in this case the position of the characters in the string is important.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.540
For example if we have the string Python it's important for the piece to come before the Y to come before

01:13.540 --> 01:14.510
the T and so on.

01:14.530 --> 01:19.920
Otherwise the letters are all scrambled up and we end up you know with the Sunday jumble.

01:20.290 --> 01:28.000
So the sequence is a sequence of characters but the order is definitely important and it's important

01:28.000 --> 01:34.750
that the older not just change right in a list which is mutable you can change the order of the items

01:34.750 --> 01:36.040
in the list in a string.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.140
You cannot.

01:37.420 --> 01:41.500
And so the first character is always the fourth character and so on.

01:41.860 --> 01:48.130
And we need to think of topples in the same light as well a top all we can think of as a data record

01:48.250 --> 01:54.810
or a data structure where the position of the item in the table has meaning.

01:54.910 --> 01:57.690
In other words this is the first element of the top.

01:57.700 --> 02:04.300
This is the second element of the table that's important and that's not going to change the fourth element

02:04.300 --> 02:07.650
is always going to be the first element because topples are immutable.

02:07.810 --> 02:13.710
We can assign a meaning to the position of the value in the table just like we have over a string.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.880
And that's why we're going to start covering tuples without even considering sequence types will dig

02:18.880 --> 02:21.070
into sequence types in much more detail.

02:21.130 --> 02:25.550
But right now we know enough about sequences when out iterate them using a for loop.

02:25.690 --> 02:29.330
We know how to get the or an element by index and so on.

02:29.470 --> 02:34.920
That's good enough to deal with topples as a data structure or a data record.

02:35.050 --> 02:41.140
And of course we'll take a look at a related concept called the named topple the name top all is something

02:41.140 --> 02:48.220
that not only will allow us to have the position have meaning but also actually give that position a

02:48.220 --> 02:48.810
name.

02:48.820 --> 02:54.730
And so in that respect it's much closer to what we think of as a data record like in a database or in

02:54.730 --> 02:55.820
a class.

02:55.960 --> 03:01.560
If a class represents a data record we're used to having a name associated with the value.

03:01.990 --> 03:07.490
Well we don't have that we have regular topples we have the position associated with the value.

03:07.690 --> 03:08.970
But we've named topples.

03:09.070 --> 03:13.210
In addition Now we can actually associate a name with each position.

03:14.150 --> 03:14.620
All right.

03:14.660 --> 03:15.700
So let's dig in.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.030
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
