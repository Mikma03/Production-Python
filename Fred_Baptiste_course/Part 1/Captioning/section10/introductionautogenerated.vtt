Hi and welcome to the extras section.

00:03.210 --> 00:07.020
I wasn't sure what to call it so finally I just ended up calling get extras.

00:07.020 --> 00:08.770
It's kind of generic and bland.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.870
So what's in the section.

00:11.130 --> 00:13.750
Well it's really a mixed bag of a lot of different things.

00:13.770 --> 00:19.230
It's going to be things like tips and tricks you know as I find something that I think would be important

00:19.230 --> 00:20.190
to highlight.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.770
I'll throw it into here.

00:22.140 --> 00:24.540
It's going to be things about pythonic code.

00:24.540 --> 00:26.780
In other words idiomatic coding in Python.

00:27.030 --> 00:32.220
Well you know would you rather code something this way or do it some other way and maybe there's a more

00:32.580 --> 00:34.300
idiomatic way of doing it.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.630
That's more pythonic.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.620
So I'll point those out as necessary.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.320
We've already done some of those in the course already.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.750
It's going to be opinionated.

00:42.780 --> 00:48.540
I'm going to give you my opinions and my opinions aren't my opinions and you're free to form your own

00:48.540 --> 00:51.510
opinions but I am going to be opinionated in here.

00:51.660 --> 00:57.840
So I will have some very strong opinions about certain you know coding styles and because that's what

00:57.840 --> 00:58.580
I follow.

00:58.740 --> 01:05.500
And you know you can obviously make up your own it's going to be also things that I find interesting.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.750
Very often I run across something on the web or on Twitter.

01:09.010 --> 01:13.300
You know regality Python but I think hey that's that's kind of cool that's interesting.

01:13.450 --> 01:20.110
I'll throw all those in here as well and I will try and stay within the confines of what this particular

01:20.110 --> 01:21.600
part of the course covers.

01:21.640 --> 01:27.010
So I'll try and stick to you know functions and closures and things like that are not going to get into

01:27.010 --> 01:28.880
things like metaprogramming and so on.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.140
Those are for the subsequent sections of the calls.

01:32.260 --> 01:39.010
So I'll stick to things that you should know by the time you've finished doing the scores and it will

01:39.010 --> 01:39.880
grow over time.

01:39.940 --> 01:46.000
As I keep finding things I'm just going to keep adding you know these kind of video Shulz to the to

01:46.000 --> 01:48.290
this section.

01:48.310 --> 01:52.690
Now this is not going to be a discussion on third party libraries.

01:52.690 --> 01:56.720
You know it's not going to be hey you know let's take a look at library X Y Z.

01:56.890 --> 02:00.150
It might if it's a library that really used a lot.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.810
And that's simple enough to cover in a short video.

02:03.100 --> 02:09.600
But I am not going to do a discussion for example on pandas so on none pie or on you know.

02:09.790 --> 02:13.740
Well Type-I has a total right now as of today.

02:13.750 --> 02:19.460
I looked it up this morning 128 you know hundred twenty nine thousand packages.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.090
So that's a lot to cover.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.620
Which means that everybody is going to be using slightly different packages so I don't want to make

02:26.620 --> 02:29.090
this discussion on package X Y Z.

02:29.350 --> 02:35.860
I really want to focus like this whole Coles has on actual the Python language and the Python standard

02:35.860 --> 02:38.920
library because that's really where we need to start.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.120
Right.

02:39.130 --> 02:42.160
We need to understand how to use Python in the standard library.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.290
And then of course when we don't have something in our disposal in the standard library or in Python

02:47.340 --> 02:53.140
built ins then we start looking at third party libraries and then there's always a host of possible

02:53.320 --> 03:00.060
you know libraries to do that do the same thing and then also your suggestions.

03:00.090 --> 03:05.300
Send me your suggestions and I will make sure videos if it's you know if I can.

03:05.310 --> 03:11.250
First of all and secondly if it you know if I feel that it's a placable to more than just you know yourself

03:11.310 --> 03:15.060
or a few people so you get something that's general enough.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.340
Then I will do it.

03:16.560 --> 03:22.150
And obviously you know I'm not going to start doing extra videos here on async programming.

03:22.170 --> 03:23.960
That comes later on in the course.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.950
And so we'll do it there.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.700
So we all but short questions show topics.

03:28.710 --> 03:33.510
Please send me those suggestions and I'll be more than happy to make a video out of it.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.510
All right so thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy the show.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.340
Mixed bag in the section.

03:38.340 --> 03:39.020
See you in a bit.
