00:00.110 --> 00:05.910
Hi here's one last thing I want to show you in the random library and it's the samples method.

00:05.910 --> 00:09.390
So let's just recall what we did with the choices.

00:09.450 --> 00:09.720
Right.

00:09.720 --> 00:17.490
So if we have let's say random choices we can choose from a list let's say of three characters containing

00:17.490 --> 00:18.490
a b and c.

00:18.660 --> 00:26.310
And since it does the random pics with replacement It means that we can actually pick more items that

00:26.340 --> 00:27.390
are in the list.

00:27.390 --> 00:32.970
So in this case we just get these things repeated because every time basically we make a new choice

00:33.060 --> 00:34.070
of ABC.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.800
We can do this of course as many times as we want.

00:36.930 --> 00:41.990
Sometimes however what we want to do is we want to pick a random selection from a population.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.350
So we want to do a random sample which means that essentially we wanted two choices but without replacement

00:48.870 --> 00:49.590
here's what I mean.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.790
Let's take a look at a simple list.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.460
Let's look at all equal to a list of range of 10 for example and I'll make it into a list so we could

00:58.470 --> 01:00.270
print it.

01:00.900 --> 01:06.030
So let's say this is my population and what I want to do is I'm going to pick a random sample out of

01:06.030 --> 01:09.900
that population let's say upsized 5.

01:09.930 --> 01:19.700
Now if I was to use the choices so far 5 did random choices and we'll take l and with say cake will

01:19.710 --> 01:20.990
to five.

01:21.150 --> 01:23.820
Then we run the risk of having repetitions.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.310
And indeed we had it.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.620
In this case here.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.280
But that's not what we want.

01:28.290 --> 01:32.890
If we've picked six once already we want to not have six come up again.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.660
We don't want replacement and this is with sample comes in.

01:36.660 --> 01:41.280
So instead of doing random choices we would do random sample.

01:41.430 --> 01:46.750
We would tell that which list to sample from and then we also have to specify how many samples we want.

01:46.750 --> 01:51.530
So like KCl 5 we can run this any time any number of times we want.

01:51.630 --> 01:54.350
We won't get elements repeated.

01:54.390 --> 01:59.280
What this means of course is that you cannot specify K greater than the sample length.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.740
Here are sample or then the population length.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.890
So here our population has one has ten elements.

02:06.030 --> 02:10.280
So we can go up to 10 but we certainly can go beyond 10.

02:10.440 --> 02:16.500
We'll get an exception right smaller sampler sample larger than the population or is negative.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.870
We can have a negative sample size either.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.050
So when might this come in useful.

02:21.120 --> 02:27.120
Well if you for example selecting random counts from a deck of Count You obviously don't want to have

02:27.180 --> 02:32.160
count repeated because once you have drawn a count from the deck you can't possibly pick it again if

02:32.160 --> 02:34.070
it's a standard deck of cards.

02:34.380 --> 02:37.020
So let's take a look at just a simple example of that.

02:37.020 --> 02:41.580
Let's go ahead and build a deck and first thing I'm going to want to build is my soup's.

02:41.610 --> 02:44.260
So for the suits I'm going use a top.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.910
We're going to have clubs.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.660
We're going to have diamonds.

02:47.670 --> 02:52.910
We're going to have hearts and we're going to have spades.

02:52.950 --> 02:53.500
OK.

02:53.760 --> 03:00.700
And then for my ranks I'm going to use the numbers so I'm going to make a way we can make a topple out

03:00.720 --> 03:01.480
of that as well.

03:01.500 --> 03:07.810
We're going to take the range from two up to and including 10 so range 2 through 11 plus.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.740
And then I want to append to that.

03:09.930 --> 03:12.340
What I want to append the jack.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.220
So actually I'm going to do it this way.

03:14.220 --> 03:17.300
I want to append jack queen king ace.

03:17.310 --> 03:20.680
So I'll make a table out of that and we'll form our ranks.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.490
Now look at our suits.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.420
We have that.

03:23.430 --> 03:28.600
And if you look at the ranks we have that what I want to do though is I want to create a deck.

03:28.610 --> 03:32.100
The deck should look something like the two of clubs.

03:32.210 --> 03:36.190
The three of clubs all the way up to the ace of clubs.

03:36.230 --> 03:40.310
Then we have the two of diamonds all the way up to the ace of diamonds.

03:40.320 --> 03:46.340
Then the two of hearts up to the Ace of Hearts and then the two of spades all the way up to the ace

03:46.340 --> 03:47.040
of spades.

03:47.060 --> 03:47.300
Right.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.860
So that's what we want to do 52 counts.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.780
So really this is a nested loop.

03:51.800 --> 03:57.440
We have to loop through the suits to get each suit and then for each suit we have to tack on the rank

03:57.500 --> 03:58.450
in front of it.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.180
And then we had gone to the next suit and do the same thing.

04:01.460 --> 04:03.350
So we could certainly use a double loop.

04:03.350 --> 04:04.630
We could do something like this.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.860
That equals that.

04:05.870 --> 04:16.160
And then with say fourth suit in our pocket and type four suit in suits and then four rank in ranks

04:16.500 --> 04:21.890
and we would say decked out of hand whether we want to append we want to take the rank so it would take

04:21.890 --> 04:25.790
a string of the rank because right now my ranks could be numbers or strings.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.640
So I'm going to convert that to a strength.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.660
I'm going to concatenate onto that.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.620
The suit itself can't.

04:31.910 --> 04:37.430
And so now if we print the deck we have a deck as expected two of clubs three of clubs all the way up

04:37.430 --> 04:38.320
to the ace of clubs.

04:38.330 --> 04:41.510
Then the two of diamonds all the way up through the ace of spades.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.740
Now of course again this isn't the cleanest way of doing it.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.390
Much simpler is to use a list comprehension.

04:47.450 --> 04:52.220
So we're going to basically take that code and rewrite it as a comprehension.

04:53.810 --> 04:59.940
So this is the element we want to generate for each element of the resulting list.

05:00.260 --> 05:09.560
And we're going to do this for what 12 full suits in suits and fold deck in a full deck for rank and

05:09.560 --> 05:10.290
ranks.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.070
OK.

05:11.630 --> 05:12.500
The same thing.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.270
It's just right.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.710
Written using a list comprehension.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.400
And there we go we have all deck.

05:17.480 --> 05:17.720
Right.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.030
So pretty straightforward.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.640
Now let's go ahead and choose a random sample.

05:22.640 --> 05:28.400
Now if we were to use choices we would get something like random choices from the deck and let's say

05:28.670 --> 05:30.370
we want to choose 10.

05:30.950 --> 05:35.630
And I don't know if we're going to get any repetitions or we're going to see necessarily but eventually

05:35.660 --> 05:36.610
we will.

05:36.650 --> 05:36.910
Right.

05:36.920 --> 05:44.240
If we make this large enough let's say we want to choose you know 40 counts then we're probably going

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
to get some repetition.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.540
How can we figure that out.

05:46.760 --> 05:52.710
Well we can look at random dot and Ringle what that class name was counted.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.530
Actually it's not in random.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.020
Sorry.

05:56.070 --> 05:58.940
Let's go ahead and import it.

05:59.060 --> 06:03.730
So from collections import count.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.530
OK.

06:04.790 --> 06:09.020
And then what we're going to do here we're going to look at counter all this.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.740
And if you see well yeah we can see the 10 of diamonds.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.050
No.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.730
10 of the hands of Jared wants that we go for pass was generated twice.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.310
Nine of diamonds was generated twice.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.000
QUEEN OF DIAMONDS three times Jack of Spades three times.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.970
That's because we have replacement when we use choices.

06:24.980 --> 06:32.170
So instead with we have to do is we have to use random dots sample and again or just pass the deck in.

06:32.230 --> 06:38.420
And then we'll make that say we're pull 10 cards out and we won't get repetition even if we look at

06:38.480 --> 06:40.820
let's say pulling 40 counts out of this.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.620
We're not going to get repetition.

06:42.810 --> 06:43.850
And let's check that.

06:43.850 --> 06:44.940
Using counters.

06:45.410 --> 06:48.810
And as you can see everything in there is a 1.

06:48.860 --> 06:55.180
In fact we can go all the way up to 52 and we won't get a repetition because this is a sample.

06:55.190 --> 06:59.630
This is not just replacing choice selection.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.160
All right.

07:00.200 --> 07:00.920
Thanks for watching.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.990
I'll see you in the next video.
