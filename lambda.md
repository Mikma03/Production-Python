### Definition

A `lambda` function is a small anonymous function in Python. "Anonymous" means a function that is without a name. While normal functions are defined using the `def` keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword.

### Syntax

The syntax of a `lambda` function is quite simple:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- **`lambda`**: A keyword that signifies that this is a lambda function.
- **`arguments`**: (Optional) The parameters or inputs to the function.
- **`expression`**: A single expression that the function returns.

### Characteristics

- **Anonymity**: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they are not declared with the standard `def` keyword.
- **Simplicity**: They can have any number of parameters but can only have one expression.
- **Usage**: They are used for short-duration, non-reusable operations.
- **Return**: The expression value is returned on execution.

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example to illustrate a `lambda` function:

```python
# Lambda function that adds 10 to the number passed in as an argument
f = lambda x: x + 10
print(f(5))  # Output: 15
```

### Explanation and Use-cases

1. **Single-use or temporary functions**: When you need a function for a short period of time and do not want to formally define it.
    
2. **Functional arguments**: Passing a function as an argument to higher-order functions, such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
    
### Extended Examples

#### Example 1: Using `lambda` with `map()`

`map()` applies a given function to all the items in an input list (or any other iterable).

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x**2, my_list))
```

#### Example 2: Using `lambda` with `filter()`

`filter()` creates a list of elements for which a function returns `True`.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_list = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list))
```

#### Example 3: Using `lambda` with `reduce()`

`reduce()` applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.

```python
from functools import reduce

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, my_list)
```

Let's check the output of the extended examples by running the code snippets.

```python
from functools import reduce

# Example 1: Using lambda with map()
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x**2, my_list))

# Example 2: Using lambda with filter()
even_list = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list))

# Example 3: Using lambda with reduce()
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, my_list)

(squared_list, even_list, product)

# RESULT
([1, 4, 9, 16, 25], [2, 4], 120)
```

#### Example 1: Using `lambda` with `map()`

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x**2, my_list))

# Output: 1,4,9,16,251,4,9,16,25
```


Each element of `my_list` is squared.

#### Example 2: Using `lambda` with `filter()`

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_list = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list))

# Output: 2,42,4
```

Only the even numbers are retained from `my_list`.

#### Example 3: Using `lambda` with `reduce()`

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, my_list)

# Output: 120
```

The product of all elements in `my_list` is calculated as (1×2×3×4×5=120)(1×2×3×4×5=120).

Lambda functions can be very useful for performing quick calculations without defining a full function. However, they should be used judiciously to ensure that code remains readable. If a computation is complex or requires documentation, it's often better to define a traditional function using `def`.
