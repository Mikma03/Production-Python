# Python tools and surroundings

This part of the file is maily for gather useful links and materials for Python project: started from web to data sciecne. Mostly about Python additional surroundings not language itself.

For example: testing, creating docs, building dependencies and so on.

This part is very live and dynamic, because something still going on Python market.

Nevertheless this part is important because could be used as reference repo and in the future as first line of defence in case of looking for python-prod materials and tips.
