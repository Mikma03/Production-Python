    "When you run this program on a Unix-based system, you should see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parent process will print its version of `x` (100), then change it to 300.\n",
    "- The child process will print its version of `x` (also 100, as it's a copy of the parent's memory space), then change it to 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each process (parent and child) has its own copy of the variable `x`, so changes in one process do not affect the variable in the other process. This is due to the copy-on-write mechanism used by `fork()` in most Unix-based operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial **parent** process in the context of a program using `os.fork()` is the process that executes the `fork()` system call. In a typical scenario, this is the process that you start when you run your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Before `os.fork()` is Called**: When you execute a Python script, the operating system creates a process to run this script. This process is what we refer to as the parent process. It's the original process that begins the execution of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **At the Moment of `os.fork()` Execution**: The line `pid = os.fork()` in your script is a critical point. When the Python interpreter reaches this line, the `fork()` system call is executed. This call results in the creation of a new process, which is a duplicate of the current process (the parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **After `os.fork()` is Called**: Once `fork()` has been called, there are now two processes in execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The **Parent Process**: This is the original process that initiated the `fork()`. It continues executing the subsequent lines of code following the `fork()` call. In your script, this process will receive the PID of the child process as the return value of `fork()`, which is a positive non-zero integer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The **Child Process**: This is the new process created by `fork()`. It is an almost exact copy of the parent process at the time of the `fork()` call. This process will receive a return value of `0` from the `fork()` call, signifying that it is the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the context of your Python script, the initial parent process is the process running your script from the start until the `fork()` call, after which it becomes one of two processes (the parent and the child) running parallelly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is crucial for the processes to know their roles and execute the corresponding code. In a typical `fork()` use case, after the fork, you have two processes running the same code, and they can use the PID value returned by `fork()` to decide which part of the code to execute. If `pid == 0`, the process executes the child-specific code; if `pid > 0`, it executes the parent-specific code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of zero as the return value of `fork()` in the child process is a convention in Unix-like operating systems. This design choice is made for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness and Simplicity**: Zero is a unique value that can unambiguously indicate the child process. In the context of process IDs (PIDs), all valid PIDs are positive integers. Therefore, using zero, which is not a valid PID, clearly differentiates the child process inside the `fork()` call. It's a simple and effective way to distinguish the child process from the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: In Unix-like systems, system calls typically return a non-zero value to indicate an error. Since positive integers are used for valid PIDs of the parent process, and negative values could be used to indicate an error, zero becomes a convenient and logical choice for indicating success in the child process. It signifies that `fork()` has successfully created a child process without any error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coding Clarity**: Using zero for the child process simplifies the code that follows `fork()`. It allows for clear, readable, and straightforward conditional statements to control the flow of the program. For example, `if (pid == 0)` is immediately recognizable as the code path for the child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using zero as the return value in the child process is a convention rooted in the design principles of Unix-like systems, aiming for simplicity, clear error handling, and ease of understanding in programming.\n"

    "Let's break down what the program will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open a File**: The program first opens a file using the `open()` system call. This call returns a file descriptor, which is an integer that uniquely identifies an open file for the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Call `fork()`**: After opening the file, the program calls `fork()` to create a new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access by Child and Parent**: Both the child and parent processes can access the file descriptor returned by `open()`. Since `fork()` duplicates the process, the child process inherits file descriptors from the parent process, including the one associated with the opened file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concurrent Writing**: If both processes (parent and child) attempt to write to the file at the same time, their outputs might interleave. This means that the data written to the file by the parent and child processes might be mixed in a non-deterministic manner, leading to a potential data inconsistency or corruption, unless properly managed.\n",

    "\n",
    "This script opens a file, then forks a new process. Both the parent and the child processes write to the file. The `write_to_file` function includes a delay to simulate the scenario where both processes attempt to write to the file around the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when two processes write to the same file simultaneously without any coordination mechanism (like locks), the resulting file content might not be what you expect. To avoid such issues, you typically need to implement some form of synchronization, such as file locks, to ensure that only one process writes to the file at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code structure executes the writing in a sequential manner in the context of each individual process. However, since fork() creates a separate child process, the parent and child processes run independently and concurrently at the system level. This means that while the code in each process executes sequentially, the parent and child processes themselves are running in parallel."

    "\n",
    "3. **Additional Control**: `waitpid()` offers more control over different child states beyond just termination. For example, it can detect if a child process has stopped executing (but not terminated), which can be useful for implementing certain types of process control in more complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: `waitpid()` allows for more detailed error handling since you can check the status of a specific child process and respond accordingly.\n",
