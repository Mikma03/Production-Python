In Python, classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the context of object-oriented programming, a class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects.

**Classes and Instances:** 

A class in Python defines a type of object according to the behaviours (methods) and kinds of data (attributes) it supports. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. For example, if `Dog` is a class, then a specific dog `buddy` would be an instance of the `Dog` class.

**Attributes and Methods:** 

Attributes are data stored "inside" an instance, and methods are functions attached to an instance that can manipulate the instance's attributes or perform other operations. In Python, attributes and methods are accessed via dot notation (e.g., `instance.attribute` or `instance.method()`).

**The `self` Parameter:** 

The `self` parameter in a method definition inside a class is a reference to the instance on which the method is being called. `self` is not a reserved keyword in Python, but it is a strong convention. It's the first parameter of any method that operates on an instance, and Python passes the instance to `self` automatically when the method is called.

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Instance method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    # Another instance method
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
```

In this `Dog` class:

- `species` is a class attribute, shared by all instances of `Dog`.
- `name` and `age` are instance attributes, unique to each `Dog` instance.
- `description` and `speak` are instance methods.

Creating instances and using methods:

```python
# Create a Dog instance
buddy = Dog("Buddy", 5)

# Access instance attributes
print(buddy.name)  # Outputs: Buddy
print(buddy.age)   # Outputs: 5

# Call instance methods
print(buddy.description())  # Outputs: Buddy is 5 years old
print(buddy.speak("Woof"))  # Outputs: Buddy says Woof
```

When `buddy.speak("Woof")` is called, Python internally translates this to `Dog.speak(buddy, "Woof")`. The `buddy` instance is passed to the `speak` method as the `self` parameter, which allows `speak` to access the `name` attribute of `buddy`.

**Why Use `self`?** Using `self` is all about context. Within a class, you might have multiple methods that all need to interact with the same data. `self` keeps track of the individual instance's data, so if you have multiple instances of `Dog`, they each maintain their own separate data.

**Encapsulation:** This concept is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming. It's the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data. In Python, encapsulation is implemented using private (denoted by underscores) and public members in a class.

**In Summary:** Classes and instances are fundamental in Python's object-oriented programming model. `self` provides a way to access instance data and methods, allowing each instance to maintain its own state and behavior. By using classes, you can create complex data structures that encapsulate attributes and functions into a single entity, making it easier to build modular and scalable code.

Python script snippet that demonstrates how class instances maintain their own state and how the `self` parameter is used to access and modify instance attributes. It also includes print statements for debugging and understanding the flow of execution.

```python
class Dog:
    species = 'Canis familiaris'  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    def description(self):
        return f'{self.name} is {self.age} years old'

    def speak(self, sound):
        return f'{self.name} says {sound}'

# Create two instances of Dog
buddy = Dog('Buddy', 5)
jack = Dog('Jack', 3)

# Accessing instance attributes
print(f'Buddy is {buddy.age}')  # Outputs: Buddy is 5
print(f'Jack is {jack.age}')    # Outputs: Jack is 3

# Calling instance methods
print(buddy.description())      # Outputs: Buddy is 5 years old
print(jack.description())       # Outputs: Jack is 3 years old

# Demonstrating that each instance maintains its own state
buddy.age += 1
print(buddy.description())      # Outputs: Buddy is 6 years old
print(jack.description())       # Outputs: Jack is 3 years old

# Using class attribute
print(f'Buddy is a {buddy.species}')  # Outputs: Buddy is a Canis familiaris
print(f'Jack is a {jack.species}')    # Outputs: Jack is a Canis familiaris

# Modifying class attribute
Dog.species = 'Canis lupus familiaris'
print(f'Buddy is now a {buddy.species}')  # Outputs: Buddy is now a Canis lupus familiaris
print(f'Jack is now a {jack.species}')    # Outputs: Jack is now a Canis lupus familiaris
```


This code creates a `Dog` class with a class attribute `species` and instance attributes `name` and `age`. It demonstrates how each instance (`buddy` and `jack`) maintains its own state, how instance methods use `self` to access these attributes, and how class attributes are shared across instances. It also shows the effect of modifying a class attribute and how it impacts all instances of the class.

Python script snippet that demonstrates how calling an instance method like `buddy.speak('Woof')` translates to `Dog.speak(buddy, 'Woof')` internally in Python. It includes a custom print function to show the equivalence of the calls and how `self` is used within a method.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self, sound):
        # Print the 'self' parameter to show it's the 'buddy' instance
        print(f'self is {self}, which has name: {self.name}')
        return f'{self.name} says {sound}'

# Custom print function to simulate what Python does internally
def custom_print(method, *args, **kwargs):
    print(f'Calling {method.__name__}() with self={args[0]} and sound={args[1]}')
    return method(*args, **kwargs)

# Create an instance of Dog
buddy = Dog('Buddy')

# Call the instance method normally
normal_call = buddy.speak('Woof')
print(f'Normal call result: {normal_call}')

# Call the instance method using our custom print function to simulate internal behavior
simulated_internal_call = custom_print(Dog.speak, buddy, 'Woof')
print(f'Simulated internal call result: {simulated_internal_call}')


# Results

# self is <__main__.Dog object at 0x11b860d10>, which has name: Buddy
# Normal call result: Buddy says Woof
# Calling speak() with self=<__main__.Dog object at 0x11b860d10> and sound=Woof
# self is <__main__.Dog object at 0x11b860d10>, which has name: Buddy
# Simulated internal call result: Buddy says Woof
```
