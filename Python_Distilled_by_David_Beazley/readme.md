# Notes for chaper 1

When you use Python interactively, the variable _ holds the result of the last operation. This is useful if you want to use that result in subsequent statements. This variable only gets defined when working interactively, so don’t use it in saved programs.

You can exit the interactive interpreter by typing quit() or the EOF (end of file) character. On UNIX, EOF is Ctrl+D; on Windows, it’s Ctrl+Z.
